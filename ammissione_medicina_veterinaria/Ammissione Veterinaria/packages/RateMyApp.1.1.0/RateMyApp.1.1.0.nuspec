    <description>When the application with Rate My App component is started for the 5th time, a dialog for reviewing the app is shown to the user. If the user declines to review the app, he/she will be given the option to provide direct feedback to the developer. On the 10th run of the app, if a review was not already collected, the user will be prompted one more time to rate the app. Developers can customize the counters as well as the strings rendered in the dialog.</description>
    <summary>The Rate My App component is used to create prompts that appear at set intervals and allow the user to provide feedback and rate the application in the Windows Phone Store.</summary>
